            <li>Then press the (+) button to add new repository.</li>
            <li>Make SURE the name of the repository is the SAME as the folder you are gonna make.</li>
            <li>Then add the code provided by Github one by one.</li>
            <li>git init is used to initialize. Once per project is enough.</li>
            <li>Use git add . to add the file. Must be used for every new file?</li>
            <li>Then paste the rest of the code as it is. But change the commit to a new one.</li>
            <li>If it's your first time, you may need to add your email and github User name because after commit you will get a fatal error if it is your first time.</li>
